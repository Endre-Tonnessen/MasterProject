    Stress granules act like shields for cellular machinery when there are stress factors (heat, toxins) that affect the cell.
    These granules are in LLPS. Normally they should appear (concentrate?) and then disperse, however sometimes they instead solidify and stay around. This is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases.
        -> Motivation for creating computational tools to analyse stress granule data.
            Spesifically: Using machine learning for boundry extration of stress granules, can we capture granules that would otherwise be discarded and thrown out. Current method is only capable of captuing 1-5% of avialable granules.
